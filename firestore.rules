/**
 * @file RecruitTrack Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model for the RecruitTrack internal hiring platform.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - `/jobs/{jobId}`: Stores job postings. Accessible for reading by everyone, but write access is limited to HR/Admin (simulated using a roles_admin collection).
 * - `/candidates/{candidateId}`: Stores candidate profiles.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Indicates admin role. Existence of document grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Jobs are publicly readable, but writes are restricted to authorized users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Candidates denormalize `jobAppliedFor` to allow secure listing of candidates for a given job.
